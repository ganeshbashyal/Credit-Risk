## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

## Credit Risk

Effective portfolio management does not only focus on distribution of funds but also identifying the type of risks and mitigate or eliminate. For a Bank the risk of credit risk is default on a debt by the borrower due to failed payments. The goal of Credit Risk identification and mitigation is to maximise the risk adjusted rate of return by maintaining credit risk exposure within acceptable parameters.

The problem itself poses a classification problem that is inherently imbalanced. Generally speaking, the number of healthy loans are a lot higher than the number of risky loans.




## Analysing Data using Pyhton

In this analysis, Python will be used to perform the following:

## Data Processing

Import the data 
Create label sets and features
Split the data 

## Machine Learning
 
. Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`).

2. Save the predictions on the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (`X_test`) and the fitted model.

3. Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:

    * Calculate the accuracy score of the model.

    * Generate a confusion matrix.

    * Print the classification report.



* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.


* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary



Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
